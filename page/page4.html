    Chapter Two: Rainy Day</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The day after Wednesday came along, my watch shows 11 am, I went to the canteen to have lunch with my friends. After finishing my lunch and have a chit-chat with my friends, my watch shows 10 minutes to 2 am. I start going to my class at number 10th building,
    and suddenly a phone call just came in. Kring Kring, I picked up the phone and pressed the green button, and it's her calling me. She asks if I was going to the class because her friend will skip the class and she asks to take an empty seat. I arrived
    early than she is, I took the empty seat beside me for her. One two three, she came from the door with her gorgeous eyes and placed beside me. I start having a conversation with her, regards the subjects. Tik Tok Tik Tok, my watch just past 4 pm and
    its the end of my class. I'm walking outside while talking to her about some random topics and its economics. At the end of speaking, she asks me if I can take her to grocery shops in front of our college by my motorcycle, without thinking, I directly
    said: "Let’s go !” It’s rainy a little bit outside, I took her to a grocery shop and accompanied her shopping. She likes to cook, it's the same hobby as I am. She bought tenderloin, potato, milk, and butter to cook homemade steak and mashed potatoes.
    After the purchase, she told me that she is waiting for her dad to come to pick her about one or two hours from now, knowing that she will be waiting for a long time by herself, I ask her if she wants to go to have some coffee with me at Starbucks
    near the grocery store. She agrees, I took her to the coffee shops and bought signature iced java chip with white cream as for her and me. I start to look at some empty seats for both of us and found one but its smoking area, and she told me she doesn't
    like smokers. Because I knew that she didn't like smokers, so I stop smoking.
