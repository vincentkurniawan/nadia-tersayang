    The conversation between me and her started, and it was enjoyable, she is a lovely person to talk to. Clock pasts about an hour, and I weren't realizing it because I dive deep into the fun, long-last conversation with her. It’s getting late, and I’m still
    waiting for her to be picked up by her father. Until finally her father came and picked her up, I go home with smiles on my heart and my mind. She is an adorable person to be friends with. I arrive at home and start having a chat conversation with
    her by LINE, and she was an easy-going person. I'm happy that I met her and took you to the grocery shops that day. I like her, but she already had a boyfriend, so I keep my distance with her.
