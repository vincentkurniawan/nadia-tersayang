    Chapter Three: Lost</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">In a continuous chat with her, she asks me if I could drive her home on the next Thursday, without thinking again, I agree. Day hits next Thursday, the class already finished and I drive her home. I don't feel nervous because I'm her friend, but I have
    a crush on her. I ask her if it was okay that I drive her home knowing that she already had a boyfriend. She was okay, and she told me that her boyfriend won't drive her home because of some excuses. I stop in front of her house and say goodbye to
    her. I got lost when I find my way home. I'm not that lost, but I need to pass narrow street. It really troublesome because of some traffic jams too, but finally I got home. It was an unforgettable experience of my life. In a chat conversation with
    her, she asks me if I could pick her up and go to college together next Thursday morning. Again, I totally could. The next Thursday came up, I woke in the morning and heated up the car engine. I drive to her house, but before finally get to her home,
    I got lost again. I forgot the street and ends up at the nowhere narrow road, and I crashed my car into an iron fence.
